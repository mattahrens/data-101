# Introduction
Welcome to the wonderful world of data!  Your journey into learning about data will be challening but rewarding.  My hope is that you will see clearly what data is, how to properly analyze data, and how to use data effectively to solve problems.  

# Course structure
The course is broken up into topic with each page focusing on a single area of data.  The beginning parts of the course introduce data concepts by working in Google Sheets to have hands-on experience with creating and organizing data.  After that, we'll dive into using Python for analyzing and visualizing data.

# Requirements
A Google account is required to create your own Google Sheets spreadsheets and your own Google Colab notebook.
