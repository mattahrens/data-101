# Introduction
Welcome to the wonderful world of data!  Your journey into learning about data will be challenging but rewarding.  My hope is that you will see clearly what data is, how to properly analyze data, and how to use data effectively to solve problems.  The following lessons are geared towards anyone interested in learning about data, but it was initially developed for students around the age of middle school to early high school.

# Course structure
The course is broken up into topic with each page focusing on a single area of data.  The beginning parts of the course introduce data concepts by working in Google Sheets to have hands-on experience with creating and organizing data.  After that, we'll dive into using Python for querying data using functions and Structured Query Language (SQL).  We'll end with an introduction to data visualizations in Python.

# Requirements
A Google account is required to create your own Google Sheets spreadsheet and Google Colab notebook.
