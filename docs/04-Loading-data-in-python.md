## Objectives

## Concept

We are shifting from using Google Sheets to now using the Python programming language to work with data.  Python is an easy-to-use language that was created over 30 years ago.  It has many libraries that are simple for working with data.  The main library that we'll be using is Pandas.  In Pandas, datasets are stored in a **dataframe* that is a way to store the data as rows and columns to represent the records and fields for the dataset.
