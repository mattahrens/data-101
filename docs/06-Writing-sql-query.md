# Lesson 6 - Writing SQL to query data

## Objective

- Learn what Structured Query Language (SQL) is and what its key parts are
- Understand how to write a SQL query in Python

## Concept

The past couple lessons we learned how to build data queries using functions in Python.  Now we're going to shift to writing queries in a standardized language for queries called SQL.  SQL is a language that is used in many different languages and frameworks where datasets reside.  Learning SQL is important because you can use it in many different ways.

Building a query in SQL involves using specific keywords to represent how you are interacting with the data.  Here is an overview of the main keywords that are present in a query along with a specific example query of art datasets:

Let's walk through these keywords one by one.  And as we do so, you can see how the keywords map to functions that we've already seen when working with data in Python.

### SELECT

### FROM

### JOIN + ON

### WHERE

### GROUP BY

### HAVING

### ORDER BY


## Practice: Building SQL queries in Python

## Summary
In this lesson, we learned about SQL and what the main keywords in SQL mean.  We then were able to write our own SQL queries in Python to ask questions of our data.  We saw how writing a SQL query is similar to using functions.
